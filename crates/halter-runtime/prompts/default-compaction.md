Compress the conversation into a structured summary
that preserves all information needed to continue work seamlessly. Optimize for the assistant's
ability to continue working, not human readability.

<analysis-instructions>
Before generating your summary, analyze the transcript in <think>...</think> tags:
1. What did the user originally request? (Exact phrasing)
2. What actions succeeded? What failed and why?
3. Did the user correct or redirect the assistant at any point?
4. What was actively being worked on at the end?
5. What tasks remain incomplete or pending?
6. What specific details (IDs, paths, values, names) must survive compression?
7. What constraints or instructions did the user state that must keep applying — especially
   security-relevant ones (sensitive files or data to avoid, operations that must not be
   performed, secret/credential handling rules)?
</analysis-instructions>

<summary-format>
## User Intent
The user's original request and any refinements. Use direct quotes for key requirements.
If the user's goal evolved during the conversation, capture that progression.

## Completed Work
Actions successfully performed. Be specific:
- What was created, modified, or deleted
- Exact identifiers (file paths, record IDs, URLs, names)
- Specific values, configurations, or settings applied

## Errors & Corrections
- Problems encountered and how they were resolved
- Approaches that failed (so they aren't retried)
- User corrections: "don't do X", "actually I meant Y", "that's wrong because..."
Capture corrections verbatim—these represent learned preferences.

## Constraints & Instructions
Standing instructions and constraints that must continue to apply after compaction. Reproduce
security-relevant ones verbatim: forbidden operations, sensitive files or data to avoid,
credential/secret handling rules, and any "always/never" directive the user gave.

## Active Work
What was in progress when the session ended. Include:
- The specific task being performed
- Direct quotes showing exactly where work left off (verbatim, to prevent drift)
- Any partial results or intermediate state

## Pending Tasks
Remaining items the user requested that haven't been started.
Distinguish between "explicitly requested" and "implied/assumed."
Do not invent next steps beyond what the user actually asked for.

## Key References
Important details needed to continue:
- Identifiers: IDs, paths, URLs, names, keys
- Values: numbers, dates, configurations, credentials (redacted)
- Context: relevant background information, constraints, preferences
- Citations: sources referenced during the conversation
</summary-format>

<preserve-rules>
Always preserve when present:
- Exact identifiers (IDs, paths, URLs, keys, names)
- Error messages verbatim
- User corrections and negative feedback
- Security-relevant instructions and constraints, verbatim, so they keep applying
- Specific values, formulas, or configurations
- Technical constraints or requirements discovered
- The precise state of any in-progress work
</preserve-rules>

<compression-rules>
- Weight recent messages more heavily—the end of the transcript is the active context
- Omit pleasantries, acknowledgments, and filler ("Sure!", "Great question")
- Omit system context that will be re-injected separately
- Keep each section under 500 words; condense older content to make room for recent
- If you must cut details, preserve: security constraints > user corrections > errors > active work > completed work
</compression-rules>
